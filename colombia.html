				<p>Bogotá, the vibrant capital of Colombia, is a city that offers a captivating blend of rich history, cultural diversity, and breathtaking natural landscapes.
				<br><br>
				As you explore this high-altitude metropolis nestled in the Andes Mountains, you’ll be greeted by a plethora of experiences. We recommend you take a few days (if you can) to explore all it has to offer. You can begin your journey in La Candelaria, the historic heart of the city, with its charming colonial architecture, colorful facades, and bustling markets. Don’t miss the Gold Museum, housing an unparalleled collection of pre-Columbian gold artifacts, and the Botero Museum, housing hundreds of “cherubic” works by the famous artist.
				<br><br>
				Bogotá also boasts an exciting culinary scene with a wide range of traditional Colombian dishes and international cuisine. For panoramic views of the city, visit Monserrate, a mountaintop sanctuary. The city’s dynamic street art scene and numerous parks and green spaces, like Simón Bolívar Park, add to its charm. With its friendly locals and a lively atmosphere, Bogotá is a destination that promises a memorable and authentic Colombian experience.
				<br><br>
				In Bogotá, the average low temperatures range from 7°C to 10°C (45°F to 50°F), while daytime highs typically range from 14°C to 19°C (57°F to 66°F). The city experiences two main seasons: a dry season from December to March and July to August, and a rainy season from April to June and September to November. Due to its high altitude, Bogotá’s weather can change quickly, so it’s a good idea to dress in layers and be prepared for variations.</p>

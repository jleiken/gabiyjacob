				<h2>Our Story</h2>
				<p>When Gabi moved to Seattle in 2021, she was just hoping to make some friends and settle into life in a new corner of the US. Little did she know that, only a couple weeks after moving, the guest at her roommate’s birthday party with the nice eyes would bring so much joy to her life. That guest was Jacob, and he remembers how Gabi and her laughter, trying to get comfortable on an inflatable sofa, caught his eyes that night. 
				<br><br>
				Over the next few months, our friendship and interest in each other grew - facilitated, in part, by Jacob’s access to a car and our shared affinity for trivia - until Jacob invited Gabi out on a date to the only Colombian restaurant within Seattle’s city limits. That first date was the start of a great adventure, full of laughter, joy, and love. 
				<br><br>
				Four years later, we are so excited to celebrate our wedding with you in Villa de Leyva, Colombia! The ceremony will be at Hacienda Veracruz which is a 15 minute drive from the center of town. Please make sure to read each page of this website as it contains important planning information. We can’t wait to celebrate with you!</p>

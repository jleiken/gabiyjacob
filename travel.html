				<h2>Other Information</h2>

				<p>
				Colombia is a beautiful country to visit, but like anywhere else, there are unique factors you have to take into account when planning to travel there, especially if it is your first time visiting.
				<br><br>
				Most importantly: <b>Do not rent a car.</b> You are not ready for the traffic, even if you live in LA. It is extreme and unpredictable (or maybe very predictable because there is always a lot of it). If you are so inclined, please make different private tourist transportation arrangements, but we advise you not to rent a car to drive by yourself.
				<br><br>
				Second most important, account for at least an hour after your plane lands for the customs line at the airport. It can take up to two hours for people who are not Colombian citizens. The good news is if you check a bag it will be out by the time you’re through!
				<br><br>
				Third, Bogotá is at a very high elevation (8,660 feet to Denver’s 5,200 feet). Villa de Leyva is only slightly lower (7,000 feet). First time visitors occasionally experience mild altitude sickness which can manifest as headaches, dizziness and fatigue. You can mitigate this risk by resting, drinking lots of water and avoiding alcohol on your flight.
				<br><br>
				We have listed additional important considerations below:</p>
				
				<ul>
					<li>American citizens do not need a visa to travel to Colombia as of September 2025. If you are not an American citizen, make sure to check with your consulate.</li>
					<li>Your passport should not expire within 6 months of your date of travel - if you need to renew your passport, you should start thinking about it now.</li>
					<li>While in Bogotá, for transportation, contact XXXXX on WhatsApp. This is a trusted car and driver service.</li>
					<li>While in Villa de Leyva, contact XXXXX on WhatsApp.</li>
					<li>The airport in Bogotá is very nice, with many local restaurants and shops, so don’t worry if you have to book a flight that leaves you with a little more time there than you would have normally planned. There’s lots to explore past security, and before security there are still many food options.</li>
